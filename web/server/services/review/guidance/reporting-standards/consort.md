# CONSORT 2010 Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Each item should be reported clearly. Flag missing or inadequately reported items.

## Title and Abstract
1. **Title**: Identified as a randomised trial in the title
2. **Abstract**: Structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions

## Introduction
3. **Background and objectives**: Scientific background and explanation of rationale; specific objectives or hypotheses

## Methods
4. **Trial design**: Description of trial design (e.g., parallel, factorial) including allocation ratio
5. **Participants**: Eligibility criteria for participants; settings and locations where data were collected
6. **Interventions**: Interventions for each group with sufficient details to allow replication, including how and when they were actually administered
7. **Outcomes**: Completely defined pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed. Any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons.
8. **Sample size**: How sample size was determined. When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines.
9. **Randomisation**:
   - Sequence generation: Method used to generate the random allocation sequence, type of randomisation, details of any restriction
   - Allocation concealment mechanism: Mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence, describing any steps taken to conceal the sequence until interventions were assigned
   - Implementation: Who generated the random allocation sequence, who enrolled participants, and who assigned participants to interventions
10. **Blinding**: If done, who was blinded after assignment to interventions and how. Description of the similarity of interventions.
11. **Statistical methods**: Statistical methods used to compare groups for primary and secondary outcomes. Methods for additional analyses, such as subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses.

## Results
12. **Participant flow**: For each group, the numbers of participants who were randomly assigned, received intended treatment, and were analysed for the primary outcome. Losses and exclusions after randomisation, together with reasons.
13. **Recruitment**: Dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-up. Why the trial ended or was stopped.
14. **Baseline data**: A table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for each group
15. **Numbers analysed**: For each group, number of participants included in each analysis and whether the analysis was by original assigned groups (ITT)
16. **Outcomes and estimation**: For each primary and secondary outcome, results for each group, and the estimated effect size and its precision (such as 95% CI)
17. **Ancillary analyses**: Results of any other analyses performed, including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory
18. **Harms**: All important harms or unintended effects in each group

## Discussion
19. **Limitations**: Trial limitations, addressing sources of potential bias, imprecision, and multiplicity of analyses
20. **Generalisability**: Generalisability (external validity, applicability) of the trial findings
21. **Interpretation**: Interpretation consistent with results, balancing benefits and harms, and considering other relevant evidence

## Other Information
22. **Registration**: Registration number and name of trial registry
23. **Protocol**: Where the full trial protocol can be accessed, if available
24. **Funding**: Sources of funding and other support, role of funders
