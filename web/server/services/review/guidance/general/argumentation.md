# Argumentation and Evidence Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate the logical structure and evidential support in a research paper.

## Claims and Evidence
- Every major claim should be supported by evidence (data, citations, or logical argument)
- Distinguish between claims supported by the study's own data vs. claims supported by prior literature
- Flag unsupported assertions, especially in the introduction and discussion
- Check that the strength of language matches the strength of evidence ("suggests" vs "demonstrates" vs "proves")

## Logical Flow
- The argument should progress logically from introduction through methods to results and discussion
- Each section should build on the previous one
- The research question/hypothesis should be clearly stated and follow from the background
- Results should address the stated objectives
- Discussion should interpret results in light of the research question

## Common Logical Errors
- **Overgeneralisation**: Drawing broad conclusions from limited or specific data
- **Causal claims from correlational data**: Claiming X causes Y when only association was measured
- **Cherry-picking**: Selectively reporting results that support the hypothesis while ignoring contradictory findings
- **Circular reasoning**: Using the conclusion as a premise
- **False dichotomy**: Presenting only two options when more exist
- **Appeal to authority**: Relying solely on authority rather than evidence

## Abstract Completeness
- Background/context stated
- Objective/aim clearly specified
- Methods summarized (design, setting, participants, intervention, main outcome measures)
- Key results reported with effect sizes and confidence intervals where applicable
- Conclusion follows from stated results (not overstated)

## Discussion Quality
- Results are interpreted, not merely restated
- Findings are compared with existing literature
- Limitations are acknowledged honestly and specifically
- Clinical/practical implications are discussed where appropriate
- Future research directions are suggested based on gaps identified
- Conclusions do not exceed what the data support
