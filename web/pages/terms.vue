      <h2 class="mt-12 text-base font-semibold text-stone-900">1. The Service</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        Shoulders is a writing and research environment. It includes a document editor,
        reference management, AI chat, and terminal. Files are stored locally on your machine.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">Early-stage software.</span>
        Shoulders is under active development. Features may change, be modified, or be
        discontinued. We work to ensure reliability, but you should maintain your own
        backups of important work.
      </p>

      <!-- 2 -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-base font-semibold text-stone-900">2. Accounts</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        Shoulders can be used without an account. If you create one (for the AI subscription),
        you must be at least 16 years old. You are responsible for your account security
        and for all activity under it. Notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorised access.
      </p>

      <!-- 3 -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-base font-semibold text-stone-900">3. Subscription and Billing</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        The Shoulders AI subscription is billed monthly. Subscriptions renew automatically
        until cancelled. You may cancel at any time; cancellation takes effect at the end
        of the current billing period.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">Balance.</span>
        Your subscription includes a monthly dollar balance. Unused balance does not
        roll over. Subscribers may purchase additional balance as needed. Balance is non-transferable.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">Free accounts.</span>
        Free accounts receive an initial balance to explore AI features. Once depleted,
        a subscription is required for continued AI access. The editor and all local
        features remain available without a subscription.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">Auto-recharge.</span>
        Subscribers may enable automatic recharging. When enabled, your payment method
        on file is charged automatically when your balance falls below a threshold you set.
        You can configure or disable auto-recharge at any time in your account settings.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">Refunds.</span>
        Fees are generally non-refundable. If you are unsatisfied within the first 7 days
        of your initial subscription, contact us for a full refund. We may also issue
        refunds at our discretion for service disruptions or billing errors.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">Taxes.</span>
        Stated prices exclude applicable taxes. You are responsible for any VAT, sales
        tax, or similar charges imposed by your jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        We may change subscription pricing with at least 30 days' notice. Price changes
        apply from your next billing cycle after the notice period.

      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">You own your work.</span>
        We do not claim intellectual property rights over anything you create.
        Your documents remain on your machine unless you choose to use features
        that transmit data to external services (such as AI providers).
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        If you use the Shoulders AI subscription, you grant us a limited licence to
        process your content solely to provide the service. This licence ends when
        you delete your content or close your account.

      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">Portability.</span>
        Your files are stored locally in standard formats (Markdown, LaTeX, DOCX, CSV).
        You can access, move, or delete them at any time without using Shoulders.
        There is no lock-in.

      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        AI outputs are suggestions, not professional advice. AI can produce errors
        and inaccuracies. You are responsible for verifying citations, facts, and
        critical content. AI features are subject to the terms of the underlying
        providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or others you configure).
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        AI models and capabilities may change as providers update their services.
        We do not guarantee that specific models will remain available.
      </p>

      <!-- 7 -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-base font-semibold text-stone-900">7. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        Shoulders integrates with third-party services including AI providers
        (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google), academic databases (OpenAlex, CrossRef),
        and web search (Exa). These services are governed by their own terms
        and privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for
        the availability, accuracy, or conduct of third-party services.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        If a third-party service becomes unavailable or changes its terms, we may
        modify or discontinue the affected features in Shoulders without liability.

        <span class="font-medium text-stone-700">The service is provided "as is" and "as available."</span>
        To the extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, including merchantability,

      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special,
        consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of data, loss of profits, or
        interruption of research. Our total liability is limited to the greater
        of amounts you paid us in the prior 12 months or &euro;100. Some jurisdictions
        may not allow these limitations; in such cases, liability is limited to the minimum
        extent permitted.

        You may stop using Shoulders at any time. If you have a subscription, you may

        violate these Terms or fail to pay outstanding fees.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        Upon termination, your right to use subscription features ends. Your local files
        remain on your machine and are unaffected. Account data on our servers is deleted
        within 30 days of account closure, unless retention is required by law.

        We may modify these Terms. For material changes, we provide at least 30 days' notice
        via email or in-app notification. Continued use after the notice period constitutes
        acceptance. If you disagree with the changes, you may cancel your subscription
        before they take effect.

        continue in full effect.
